For the code rit hackathon

We have made a web app which can be usefull for patients as well as doctors. It is called Medi-Help. It has two parts. One is for the doctor and another for patient. They have different login ids and passwords. The data is stored in remote database but due to shortage of time we were only able to make a static website to present our idea. The doctor has the ability to access the list of patients he/she attends to, list of appointments he/she has and the medical reports of the patients. This helps the patient as well as the doctor to save time in collecting all the reports and going through them one by one. All the things can be accessed from one place. The patient has the ability to access a list of doctors to which he/she can send reports to or can communicate regarding treatments. This app also holds the information regarding the medicine dosage of the patient. The patient can access the medical store if he/she needs more medicines. For more proper understanding and future scopes refer to the ppt.
